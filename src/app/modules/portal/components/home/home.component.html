    <h1>Welcome to my Angular demo!

    </h1>
    <div class="alert alert-primary">
      <p>Prior to 5/10/2023 I had never written a single line of Angular, nor have I ever seen any Angular code. I created this Angular site based off of the previous years of Full Stack development work I've done in other .NET MVC sites and React Sites.</p>
    </div>
    <div>Here I have:
      <ul>
        <li>Created a simple chat box. After entering your message it sends the message to a backend Node.js api that will response with some Lorem Ipsum text with your message appended to the end.</li>
        <li>Published site to a new Azura static website.</li>
        <li>Added a Github Actions CI/CD to have it publish on commit to the "main" branch.</li>
        <li>Added a login store that validates credentials with backend Node.js api server.</li>
        <li>Added a simple view to interact with a webcam.</li>
        <li><a class="btn btn-primary" href="https://github.com/ScottBorchert/CPSDemo" target="_blank">Repository for this code.</a></li>
      </ul>

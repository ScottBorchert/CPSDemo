/*
This is a unit test code file for the `VideoCamComponent` Angular component, written using the Jasmine testing framework and Angular's TestBed. The purpose of this test is to check whether the component is created successfully or not.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. Import statements:
   - `ComponentFixture` and `TestBed` are imported from `@angular/core/testing`. They provide utilities for testing Angular components.
   - `VideoCamComponent` is imported from the `./video-cam.component` module.

2. Test suite:
   - The `describe()` function is used to define a test suite (group of tests) for the `VideoCamComponent`. It takes two arguments: a string describing the test suite, and a function containing the test cases.

3. Variables:
   - `component`: An instance of the `VideoCamComponent` class.
   - `fixture`: A ComponentFixture instance for the `VideoCamComponent`. It provides access to the component's instance and its associated elements in the DOM.

4. `beforeEach()`:
   - This is a Jasmine function that is called before each test in the suite. In this case, it sets up the TestBed, creates the component, and applies the changes.
   - `TestBed.configureTestingModule()` configures the testing module with the necessary declarations.
   - `fixture = TestBed.createComponent(VideoCamComponent)` creates a new ComponentFixture for the `VideoCamComponent`.
   - `component = fixture.componentInstance` assigns the component instance to the `component` variable.
   - `fixture.detectChanges()` triggers the initial change detection.

5. Test case:
   - The `it()` function is used to define a test case. It takes two arguments: a string describing the test, and a function containing the test logic.
   - In this test case, the expectation is that the `component` should be truthy, meaning the component should be successfully created.

The test checks whether the `VideoCamComponent` is created without any issues when the Angular application is running.

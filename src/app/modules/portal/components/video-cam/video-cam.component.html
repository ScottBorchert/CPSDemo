<video #videoElement autoplay></video>

<!--
This is a simple HTML template code for the `video-cam.component.html` file, which is used by the `VideoCamComponent` Angular component. It contains a single `<video>` element that will be used to display the live video stream from the user's webcam.

Let's break down the code:

1. `<video>`: This is the HTML5 video element used to display video content.

2. `#videoElement`: This is a local reference (also called a template reference variable) that assigns an identifier to the video element. In this case, the identifier is `videoElement`. This local reference can be accessed in the component class using the `@ViewChild()` decorator, which was seen in the `VideoCamComponent` TypeScript code.

3. `autoplay`: This is an attribute that, when present, tells the browser to start playing the video automatically as soon as it can. In this case, it ensures that the video stream from the user's webcam starts playing immediately after being initialized.

So, the `VideoCamComponent` Angular component will use this template to render a `<video>` element on the page, and the live video stream from the user's webcam will be displayed in this element.
